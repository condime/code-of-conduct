### As someone who is part of this Slack, you agree that:

* We are collectively and individually committed to safety and inclusivity.
* We have zero tolerance for abuse, harassment, or discrimination.
* We respect people’s boundaries and identities.
* We refrain from using language that can be considered oppressive (systemically or otherwise), eg. sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, classist, etc. - this includes (but is not limited to) various slurs.
* We avoid using offensive topics as a form of humor.

### We actively work towards:

* Being a safe community
* Cultivating a network of support & encouragement for each other
* Encouraging responsible and varied forms of expression

### We condemn:

* Stalking, doxxing, or publishing private information
* Threats of harm, harassment
* Anything that compromises people’s safety
* Personal attacks

**These things are NOT OK.**

### If you say something that is found offensive, and you are called out on it, let’s:

* Listen without interruption.
* Believe what the person is saying & do not attempt to disqualify what they have to say.
* Ask for tips / help with avoiding making the offense in the future.
* Apologize and ask forgiveness.

Failing to follow the community guidelines as described in this document carries consequences. For minor infractions, you may be temporarily suspended from the Slack. Upon repeat offenses, or if the community believes you are not acting in good faith, you may be asked to leave permanently.

### Privacy
* All conversations are private unless otherwise specified.
* If you wish to share a conversation, or part of one, you must get permission from each person involved.

### Best Practices
Read the blog posts. Most channels have been subscribed to RSS feeds with related content. Feel free to post your own blogs and subscribe the channel to other feeds that you think might be relevent.

Stay on topic. The goal of the community is to facilitate discussion of things relating to platform engineering.
  This could be about
    - software engineering (frontend, backend, platform, data etc)
    - people management
    - security
    - networking
    - training, mentoring and learning
  or any thing else that may be important to people who write and run software.

If you have a technical question, feel free to join or create a channel for that subject.

**If you experience abuse, harassment, discrimination, or feel unsafe, let a moderator know. Here is a list of the current admins and their Slack IDs:**

## Slack Etiquette

### Slack Commands

Members of this Slack group have it open during the work day, or installed on their phones.
Additionally, there are members in many different time zones. Please be cautious about using  `@channel` or `@everyone` and avoid it if possible.

Conversely, feel free to mute or uninstall slack from your devices if that is healthy for you too.
Don't expect that everyone is online when you are online, or to expect replies from others instantly.

### Emoji

All members can upload new emoji. If you have a dispute about an existing emoji, contact an admin with the name of the emoji, an outline of the issue and an acceptable remediation (e.g. removal of the emoji).

For tips and tricks or questions about Slack usage, check out #meta.

### Q & A

Value your fellow members' time, and be considerate when asking questions. Question are welcome, but may require some research and time to answer.
Please Google for answers if you can, consult documentation if available, or ask someone (or the group in general) to pair with you to read source code.

When answering questions, avoid condescending language or impatience. We are all trying our hardest!

If you learn something new for you, share it with the rest of the group in one of the related channels or consider writing a blog post.
Even if it might have seemd obvious to others, the fact that you learnt something is still worthy to celebrate.
